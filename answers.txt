1. Choosing the right libraries. 
   Recharts,AG Grid and to use Sheet JS or Python Panda
2. Reading the data from Excel especially Dates and numbers.
3. Adding Data Granularity. 
4. Was not sure above how to calculate "Profit Ratio ","accumulated Sales" etc
5. formatting data so that it fits into excel.


Limitations:

Graph can be implemented in better reable way.
Giving the user full acess to select the data he wants to see.
Adding this Data in DB so that we dont have to read Excel everytime
Filtering of Data can be handled in better way.
Some research can be done in terms of improving performance

How app can be extended:
Adding the data into DB.So that CRUD operations can be handled easily.
Example :
Adding new sales data (single) using UI form.
Adding bulk import feature:where a can admin can import a excel and add the sales to an existing DB.
Creating different user roles:Admin, Reginal Manager etc
Once a sale person logins into the application , he can view the data where he is in charge.
A feature can be added delete the data which is no longer required.
A feature to purge orders based on time.

Flexibitily should be given to user to select the data he wants to see in graphs 

A descriptive data for the month /year can be calcuted:
Which category made good business?
From State/city we got most orders from?
Which Item was returned most etc.
